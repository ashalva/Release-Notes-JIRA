## Make release notes easier :)

### Motivation

The project is intented to make the repetitive work automated. If there are several teams in the JIRA project e.g Android and iOS, and you are asked to prepare sprint release notes you have to take only your platform tasks and start preparing the release notes.

In our team we are writing the release notes once in a two weeks and it is quite time consuming. We have to:
* Find concrete platform task e.g iOS.
* Copy the task code and paste to Wiki page.
* Link the task url under the task code.
* Copy the task title and paste it next to the task code on Wiki page.
* Group the tasks based on task type: Feature, Improvement, Bug and Other.

It is so tiring to change the tabs and do copy + paste several times. So the app will automate the process. 

### Usage
In JIRA open the drop down reports and just copy the finished tasks and paste it in to the app "Input JIRA task" field.  Select your own platform or set 'No Filter' to prepare notes for each task.

Since we want to filter out the concrete team tasks, we have to choose the team distinguisher which appears in the tasks, in our case Android, iOS or MS(Microservices). You are ready to click Filter button.
